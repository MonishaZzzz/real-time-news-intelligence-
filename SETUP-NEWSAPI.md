# üîë NewsAPI Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Free API Key

2. **Sign Up for Free**:
   - Enter your email
   - Create a password
   - Select "I am an individual"

   - Copy this key

## Step 2: Add API Key to Your App

### Option A: Direct Configuration (Quickest)

Edit `backend/main.py` line 34:
```python
# Change this line:
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE"

# To this (with your actual key):
NEWS_API_KEY = "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6"  # Your actual key
```

### Option B: Environment Variable (More Secure)

1. Create/edit `.env` file in root directory:
```
NEWS_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

2. Update `backend/main.py` line 34:
```python
NEWS_API_KEY = os.getenv("NEWS_API_KEY", "")
```

## Step 3: Test Your Configuration

Run this command to test:
```bash
python test-newsapi.py
```

## Step 4: Start Using Real News

1. **Start Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
